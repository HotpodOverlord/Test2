A Discord bot for Overwatch servers.

# Features

### Welcoming New Users

If any new user joins your server, peanut-botter will welcome them.

### Hero Role Assign

#### `role/hero <name>`

Give peanut-botter permission to manage roles on your server, and add roles that mimic the names of the heroes found in [`src/heroes.json`](src/heroes.json).

When someone mentions the bot with the word "role" or "hero", then a hero name, it'll assign you the role automatically. (e.g. "@peanut-botter role hanzo").
