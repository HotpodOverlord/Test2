## Features

### Welcoming

If any new user joins your server, peanut-botter will welcome them.

### Help

**Command**: `help`

Get a list of commands.

### Role Assign

**Command**: `role/hero <name>`

**Prerequisite**: Give the bot permission to manage roles on your server, and add roles that mimic the names of the heroes found in [`src/heroes.json`](src/heroes.json).

When someone mentions the bot with the word "role" or "hero", then a hero name, it'll assign you the role automatically. (e.g. "@peanut-botter role hanzo").

Post a random, popular post from the Overwatch subreddit that was posted in the past week.
